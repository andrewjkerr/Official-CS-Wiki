## General Information
Algorithmic Game Theory is basically what happens when CS people get involved in economics. It combines the assumptions of economics with the "let's make things tractable" attitude of CS.

## Prerequisites
 - [CS 4820 - Introduction to Algorithms](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS4820.md)

## Topics Covered
 - Nash equilibrium
 - Congestion games
 - Price of anarchy and price of stability
 - Potential games
 - Learning in games
 - Auction Theory
 - Complexity of finding equilibria

## Workload
Four problem sets, final project, and take home final. The problem sets are done collaboratively, but are generally quite difficult and time consuming.

## General Advice
Start on the problem sets early, and discuss them with other students. They can be quite challenging, and having more people allows you to get multiple perspectives and ideas out.

In Spring 2012, there wasn't a whole lot of time to work on the project, between the earlier problem sets and the take home final. You might want to start on the project much earlier (i.e., during the middle of the semester).
