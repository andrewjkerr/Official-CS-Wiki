"Don't do it. Just don't. Real explanation: Unless you are really, really interested specifically in how to make robots move somewhat accurately, it's probably not worth it. Okay, the first part of that statement is a slight exaggeration (there's some cool things like Kalman Filters that are covered), but assignments for that class generally require *much* more effort than you'd ever want to put into them."
