## General Advice
  - (For Non-CS Majors) Don't underestimate your abilities, if you work at it it's no harder than any other class
  - Don't leave the projects until the last minute, you'll make mistakes
  - Take Codecademy Python course to be familiar with the thought process
  - While they are tedious, you can complete every project on your own.

## Testimonials
I took it with Walker White in Fall 2013, and it was a really great class. The labs were a bit tedious at times, but they did help teach the material. Would recommend doing the labs beforehand so as to make better use of required time with the consultants.
