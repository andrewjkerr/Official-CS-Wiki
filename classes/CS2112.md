## General Information
An intensive honors version of [CS 2110 - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS2110.md)

## Prerequisites

CS1110 or AP Credit.

## Topics Covered
Generally the same as [[CS 2110 - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures|CS 2110]], but in significantly greater detail. In summary: you use data structures in CS 2110, you implement them yourself in CS 2112.

## Workload
Seven projects, the earlier three of which are individual and the latter four which are paired partner projects that constitute a large "final project." This class requires significantly more work than 2110 and is more comparable to a 3000 level class like [[CS 3110 - Data Structures and Functional Programming|3110]] or [[CS 3410 - Computer System Organization and Programming|3410]].

## General Advice
You will learn significantly more, and if you're serious about Computer Science, this is a much more worthwhile class to take than the non-honors version. That being said, projects are _very_ long, and many say the class has required 15-35 hours a week of work.

You will not need the book.

2nd prelim and final is open book/note. but it doesn't really help.

6000~10000 lines of code for 4~7th project in total
