# CS 2042 - UNIX Tools

## General Information
A four-week, S/U exclusive introduction to Unix tools.

## Prerequisites

## Topics Covered

## Workload

## General Advice

## Testimonials
I don't think this class is even offered anymore, but I didn't really "get" Unix Tools after taking this class. It's nice for getting a bit familiar with some of the available commands, but if you truly want to grok Unix, just force yourself to use the terminal for everything.
