## General Information
Like [CS 4110 - Programming Languages and Logics](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS4110.md), but on steroids. Much more mathematical in nature.

## Prerequisites
You probably want to know [CS 3110 - Data Structures and Functional Programming](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS3110.md) and like [CS 4110 - Programming Languages and Logics](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS4110.md)

## Topics Covered
 - Inductive proof
 - Operational semantics
 - Language features and translation
 - Axiomatic semantics
 - Denotational semantics
 - Type systems

## Workload
(Spring 2011) Not too bad. Six homeworks, a prelim (with in-class and take-home portions), and a final. Homework can be done in groups.

## General Advice

## Testimonials
I took [CS 3110 - Data Structures and Functional Programming](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS3110.md) and CS 6110. I feel like this course was "too much information," and I would have been happy with just [CS 4110 - Programming Languages and Logics](https://github.com/mrkev/Official-CS-Wiki/blob/master/classes/CS4110.md) instead, since some of the proofs were tedious and some of the topics went a bit over my head.

This class was easy but boring.
